This folder contains the apriltag models file generated by running:  
```python3 april_tags_repo/generate.py```

The scripts creates a **model/** folder inside **april_tags_rep/**, containing various different models of april tags. 
After generating, I moved the folder to the parent directory and renamed it to **april_tags_models/**, so that we can track it with git and we all have the april tags models available. 

The gz simulation *should* reference these model files, so they must be here in order for gazebo to load them properly.

To spawn these models using the gazebo resource spawner, run:  
```export GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH=~/<PATH-TO-YOUR-WORKSPACE-FOLDER>/src/april_tag_detection/april_tags_models/```

Then, from the same terminal, run gazebo:
```gz sim```

If you now add the resource spawner plugin (from top-right dropdown menu, vertical ...), you should see the april tags folder and be able to add them to the scene.
